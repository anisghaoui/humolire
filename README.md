# Documentation:
There are many README.MD files in the folders about.
The main entry point is main.py.
There is a beginning of documentation at [read the docs](https://humolire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I don't have much time. If you want to help in documentation, I would be immensely grateful.

Thank you!
