There are many README.MD files in the folders about.
The main entry point is main.py.
There is a beginning of documentation at [read the docs](https://humolire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I don't have much time. If you want to help in documentation, I would be immensely grateful. 

# Contribution:

* If you wanna help documenting (I lack the time and skills to do that correctly), open an issue.
Thank you!
